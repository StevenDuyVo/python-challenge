I used Xpert Learning Tool, Zoom recordings, and class resources to help guide me through programming both PyBank and PyPoll. 
For PyBank, I asked for help from the instructor to help solve my issues with calculating percentage change. 
  However, I was unable to figure out a solution to putting the dates for the greatest increase and decrease of Profit/Losses.
For PyPoll, I used Xpert Learning Tool to help me calculate percentage votes for each candidate. It also helped guide me in creating the overall structure of my program.

NOTE: analysis folders have a placeholder text file. You should be able to run the script for a new text file reflecting the code.
